**Simpleman's BlackJack**

*Designed in General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive*


☐ ***Background:*** 

For this project I decided to try my 'hand' at the infamous card game, Blackjack. Debatably started as early as the 16th century, Blackjack has become a staple in casinos and homes across the globe. While also known as 21, the interesting name is thanks to casinos in the 18th century hoping to draw more people with special offers. The most famous offer, of course, was a special bet for the 10:1 odds of a player having a black jack (the jack of spades or clubs) with an ace. While the special betting no longer exists, the name stuck - and with it, the beloved game of Blackjack.

☐ ***Gameplay:*** 

The goal of Blackjack is for the player to get 21, or as close as they can to 21, without going over. The player is trying to end of the game with a higher score than the dealer and vice versa. The catch? The dealer always plays second. The game's appeal is in both its simplicity and its unknown; the player never knows what the dealer is going to be dealt!


☐ ***How to play:***

To begin the game, click 'Deal.'

Once cards are dealt, the player's turn starts. As a reminder, the goal is to get as close to 21 without going over, in the hopes of ending with a higher score than the dealer. *If the player is dealt 21, the player automatically wins.* If the score is anything less than 21, the player has the option to 'hit' (accept another card at the risk of going over 21), or stand (stay put at current score).

In this example, a player might choose to hit.

Booya! The player scored 21, and when the computer had its turn, it went over 21. Player wins! Unfortunately, not every time is the player that lucky. For some other situations, let's take a peak below.

In the example above, the player risked taking another card and went over. In Blackjack, that's considered a 'Bust.' Bust is just another way of saying you lost, and the dealer won. The dealer doesn't even get a turn, because they would just stand with their current cards. But can we tie? Let's look at the picture below.

'Push' is the Blackjack word for tie. Yes, it's certainly possible and happens all the time. 

To level the playing field for the player, since the dealer ALWAYS goes second and gets to see all it has to beat, dealers often have a max limit. In this game, the limit is 17. In other words, the dealer will stop playing after scoring at least 17 no matter what, no exceptions. So, if the player scores 18 and the dealer scores 17, the dealer will be forced to stop playing and grant the win to the player.

And that's pretty much all there is to this simple version of Blackjack! There are other fancy rules, but at its core, all Blackjack games follow this format. I'd try playing this a few times before you hit the casinos with friends. Good luck!!
